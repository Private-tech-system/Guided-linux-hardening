# 🛡️ Snort IDS Lab Setup

This folder documents my personal Snort IDS (Intrusion Detection System) testing lab. All steps were performed and verified manually on my local Linux Mint system using Snort, curl, and VPN tunneling through IVPN.

## 📄 What’s Inside

- `snort-lab-setup.md`: Full step-by-step Markdown guide for setting up Snort on both VPN (`tun0`) and Wi-Fi (`wlo1`) interfaces.
- `snort-lab-setup.pdf`: A PDF version of the setup guide for easy offline reading or sharing.

## ✅ What I Did

- Installed and configured Snort from scratch
- Created and tested custom rules (e.g., for `malicious.test`)
- Verified alerts using curl and ping
- Ran Snort on both encrypted (VPN) and unencrypted (Wi-Fi) traffic interfaces
- Followed ethical testing guidelines to ensure only my own traffic was monitored

## 🤖 Note on AI Assistance

This guide was created with help from ChatGPT to document my real testing and learning process. All content was tested and confirmed in my lab environment before being posted.

Using AI helped me:
- Structure my notes cleanly
- Catch small syntax issues
- Learn how to phrase and explain Snort usage clearly
